# Gui_Program with Maritime-Dataset

This dataset contains 74 images of aerial maritime photographs taken with via a Mavic Air 2 drone and 1,151 bounding boxes, consisting of docks, boats, lifts, jetskis, and cars. This is a multi class problem.

I trained and ran the YOLOv5 model directly in the Anaconda environment.
In order to actively utilize the YOLO model, 
you need the dataset you want and an understanding of yaml files.

Next, I will train the model by collecting and labeling direct data.

# Start
